# Causal Analysis based on System Theory

Causal Analysis based on System Theory (CAST) is an accident analysis technique that maximizes learning from accidents and incidents.

## CAST goals

1. Include all causes and optimize all learning, in order to improve the whole system; do not focus on merely a few “probable causes” or one “root cause”, and do not focus on fixing merely a few areas or one area.

2. Reduce hindsight bias. 

3. Take a system’s view of human behavior. 

4. Provide a blame-free explanation of why the loss occurred; consider “why” and “how” rather than “who.”

5. Use a comprehensive accident causality model that emphasizes why the controls that were created to prevent the particular type of loss were not effective in the case at hand and how to strengthen the safety control structure to prevent similar losses in the future. 


## Terminology

<dl>

<dt>System Goals</dt> 
<dd>The reason the system was created in the first place.</dd>

<dt>System Constraints</dt>
<dd>The ways that the goals can acceptably be achieved.</dd>

<dt>Accident (sometimes called a Mishap)</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that results in a loss. For short, simply a loss.</dd>

<dt>Incident or Near-Miss</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that does not result in a loss, but could have under different conditions or in a different environment.</dd>

<dt>Hazard or vulnerability</dt>
<dd>A system state or set of conditions that, together with specific environmental conditions, can lead to an accident or loss.</dd>

<dt>Causality model</dt>
<dd>A causality model explains why something happened. For an accident, a causality model is used to explain why the accident occurred.
</dl>

<dt>Emergent properties</dt>
<dd>These arise from the relationships among the parts of the system, that is, by how they interact and fit together.</dd>

<dt>Controller</dt>
<dd>A controler adjusts the system, and recieves feeback from it, in order to manage individual components, interactions among components and emergent properties.</dd>

<dt>Process model</dt>
<dd>What a controller believes about a process, including the current state of the process, how the it operates, and how to interact with it.</dd>

<dt>Mental model</dt>
<dd>What a person believes about a process, including the current state of the process, how the it operates, and how to interact with it.</dd>


## Perspectives

<dl>

<dt>Human error is a symptom, not a cause.</dt>
<dd>A systems approach to accident causation starts from the premise that human error is a symptom of a system that needs to be redesigned. Accident analysis should identify the design flaws and recommend ways they can be fixed, not blame the operators for the consequences of those design flaws.</dd>

<dt>Blame is the enemy of saftey.</dt>
<dd>Focusing on blame seriously hinders what we learn from accidents, because important information is often deliberately hidden and research is often deliberately deflected. Focus on explanations, not accusations. Focus on the system, not the people. Focus on learning and improvements, not finger-pointing and punishments.</dd>


## Controls

Control is interpreted broadly and, therefore, includes everything that is currently done in safety engineering, plus more. 

* Component controls e.g. interlocks, barriers, fail-safes, redundancy, 
and intentional design. 

* Process controls e.g. development and training processes, manufacturing processes and procedures, maintenance processes, and general system operating processes. 

* Social controls e.g. shared value systems, organizational culture, government regulation, insurance, law, the courts, and individual self-interest.

* Human behavior can be partially controlled through the design of a societal or organizational incentive structure or other management processes. 


## System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP)

STAMP is the accident causality model that underlies CAST.

STAMP treats accidents as caused by complex interactions among physical systems, humans, and social systems. Safety is treated as a dynamic control problem rather than a failure prevention problem. No causes are omitted from the STAMP model. STAMP changes the emphasis from preventing failures to enforcing constraints on system behavior.  

Key advantages:

* STAMP applies to very complex systems because it works top-down from a high level of abstraction rather than bottom up. 

* STAMP includes software, humans, organizations, safety culture, etc. as causal factors in accidents and other types of losses without having to treat them differently or separately. 


## Comparisons

<dl>

<dt>CAST vs. System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA):</dt>
<dd>CAST assists in identifying one particular scenario that occurred, after the fact. STPA is a hazard analysis tool based on the same powerful model of causality as CAST; STPA proactive analysis can identify all potential scenarios that may lead to losses, and can prevent accidents before they happen. 

<dt>CAST vs. Root Cause Analysis (RCA):</dt>
<dd>CAST is complex and multifactorial, because systems safety covers the total spectrum of risk management. RCA aims to find a single straightforward cause for a loss; this tends to make it easier to devise a response to a loss such as a way to “solve the problem”.</dd>

<dt>CAST vs. chain-of-events causality model:</dt> CAST has a primary concern of emergent properties), which are properties that are not in the 
summation of the individual components but “emerge” when the components interact. A chain of events causality model uses an assumption of direct causality between one idependent event and the next indpendent event; also known as "Heinrich’s Domino Model" with one domino falling which triggers the next domino falling; also known as "Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model" with failures akin to holes in succesive slices.
