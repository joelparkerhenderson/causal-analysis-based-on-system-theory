Causal Analysis based on System Theory (CAST)

## Terminology

<dl>

<dt>System Goals:</dt> 
<dd>The reason the system was created in the first place.</dd>

<dt>System Constraints:</dt>
<dd>The ways that the goals can acceptably be achieved.</dd>

<dt>Accident (sometimes called a Mishap):</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that results in a loss. For short, simply a loss.</dd>

<dt>Incident or Near-Miss:</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that does not result in a loss, but could have under different conditions or in a different environment.</dd>

<dt>Hazard or vulnerability:</dt>
<dd>A system state or set of conditions that, together with specific environmental conditions, can lead to an accident or loss.</dd>

## Comparisons

<dl>

<dt>CAST vs. System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA):</dt>
<dd>CAST assists in identifying one particular scenario that occurred, after the fact. STPA is a hazard analysis tool based on the same powerful model of causality as CAST; STPA proactive analysis can identify all potential scenarios that may lead to losses, and can prevent accidents before they happen. 

<dt>CAST vs. Root Cause Analysis (RCA):</dt>
<dd>CAST is complex and multifactorial, because systems safety covers the total spectrum of risk management. RCA aims to find a single straightforward cause for a loss; this tends to make it easier to devise a response to a loss such as a way to “solve the problem”.</dd>
