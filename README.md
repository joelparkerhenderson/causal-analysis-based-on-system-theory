## Terminology

<dl>

<dt>System Goals</dt> 
<dd>The reason the system was created in the first place.</dd>

<dt>System Constraints</dt>
<dd>The ways that the goals can acceptably be achieved.</dd>

<dt>Accident (sometimes called a Mishap)</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that results in a loss. For short, simply a loss.</dd>

<dt>Incident or Near-Miss</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that does not result in a loss, but could have under different conditions or in a different environment.</dd>

<dt>Hazard or vulnerability</dt>
<dd>A system state or set of conditions that, together with specific environmental conditions, can lead to an accident or loss.</dd>

<dt>Causality model</dt>
<dd>A causality model explains why something happened. For an accident, a causality model is used to explain why the accident occurred.
</dl>

<dt>Emergent properties</dt>
<dd>These arise from the relationships among the parts of the system, that is, by how they interact and fit together.</dd>

<dt>Controller</dt>
<dd>A controler adjusts the system, and recieves feeback from it, in order to manage individual components, interactions among components and emergent properties.</dd>


## Perspectives

<dl>

<dt>Human error is a symptom, not a cause.</dt>
<dd>A systems approach to accident causation starts from the premise that human error is a symptom of a system that needs to be redesigned. Accident analysis should identify the design flaws and recommend ways they can be fixed, not blame the operators for the consequences of those design flaws.</dd>

<dt>Blame is the enemy of saftey.</dt>
<dd>Focusing on blame seriously hinders what we learn from accidents, because important information is often deliberately hidden and research is often deliberately deflected. Focus on explanations, not accusations. Focus on the system, not the people. Focus on learning and improvements, not finger-pointing and punishments.</dd>


## Comparisons

<dl>

<dt>CAST vs. System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA):</dt>
<dd>CAST assists in identifying one particular scenario that occurred, after the fact. STPA is a hazard analysis tool based on the same powerful model of causality as CAST; STPA proactive analysis can identify all potential scenarios that may lead to losses, and can prevent accidents before they happen. 

<dt>CAST vs. Root Cause Analysis (RCA):</dt>
<dd>CAST is complex and multifactorial, because systems safety covers the total spectrum of risk management. RCA aims to find a single straightforward cause for a loss; this tends to make it easier to devise a response to a loss such as a way to “solve the problem”.</dd>

<dt>CAST vs. chain-of-events causality model:</dt> CAST has a primary concern of emergent properties), which are properties that are not in the 
summation of the individual components but “emerge” when the components interact. A chain of events causality model uses an assumption of direct causality between one idependent event and the next indpendent event; also known as "Heinrich’s Domino Model" with one domino falling which triggers the next domino falling; also known as "Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model" with failures akin to holes in succesive slices.

<dt>CAST vs. System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP):</dt>
<dd>CAST is ?. STAMP underlies CAST; STAMP is based on systems theory rather than traditional decomposition and reliability theory.
