## Terminology

<dl>

<dt>System Goals</dt> 
<dd>The reason the system was created in the first place.</dd>

<dt>System Constraints</dt>
<dd>The ways that the goals can acceptably be achieved.</dd>

<dt>Accident (sometimes called a Mishap)</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that results in a loss. For short, simply a loss.</dd>

<dt>Incident or Near-Miss</dt>
<dd>An undesired, unacceptable, and unplanned event that does not result in a loss, but could have under different conditions or in a different environment.</dd>

<dt>Hazard or vulnerability</dt>
<dd>A system state or set of conditions that, together with specific environmental conditions, can lead to an accident or loss.</dd>

<dt>Causality model</dt>
<dd>A causality model explains why something happened. For an accident, a causality model is used to explain why the accident occurred.
</dl>

<dt>Emergent properties</dt>
<dd>These arise from the relationships among the parts of the system, that is, by how they interact and fit together.</dd>

<dt>Controller</dt>
<dd>A controler adjusts the system, and recieves feeback from it, in order to manage individual components, interactions among components and emergent properties.</dd>


## Comparisons

<dl>

<dt>CAST vs. System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA):</dt>
<dd>CAST assists in identifying one particular scenario that occurred, after the fact. STPA is a hazard analysis tool based on the same powerful model of causality as CAST; STPA proactive analysis can identify all potential scenarios that may lead to losses, and can prevent accidents before they happen. 

<dt>CAST vs. Root Cause Analysis (RCA):</dt>
<dd>CAST is complex and multifactorial, because systems safety covers the total spectrum of risk management. RCA aims to find a single straightforward cause for a loss; this tends to make it easier to devise a response to a loss such as a way to “solve the problem”.</dd>

<dt>CAST vs. chain-of-events causality model:</dt> CAST has a primary concern of emergent properties), which are properties that are not in the 
summation of the individual components but “emerge” when the components interact. A chain of events causality model uses an assumption of direct causality between one idependent event and the next indpendent event; also known as "Heinrich’s Domino Model" with one domino falling which triggers the next domino falling; also known as "Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model" with failures akin to holes in succesive slices.

<dt>CAST vs. System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP):</dt>
<dd>CAST is ?. STAMP underlies CAST; STAMP is based on systems theory rather than traditional decomposition and reliability theory.
